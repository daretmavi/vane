Want to build with gradients? Craft a trowel and save yourself from getting [RSI syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury).
The trowel will place a random block from your hotbar when you right-click another block.

By right-clicking the trowel in your inventory, you can change the "feed source" i.e., the inventory row
from where it takes the blocks. You can choose any inventory rows or your hotbar.
