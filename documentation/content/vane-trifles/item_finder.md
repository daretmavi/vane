Have you ever wondered, where you put those pesky ender pearls which you need like _right now_? Don't worry, the item finder has got you covered.

Use `/finditem minecraft:enderpearl` (or any other material) to search for the given item in all nearby
containers and entity inventories. (Also smite your friends if they stole it)

If you already have an item of the same type in your inventory, you can also 
shift-right-click it in your open inventory to perform a search for that item type.
