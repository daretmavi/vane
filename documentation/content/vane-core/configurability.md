```toml
title = "Full configurability"
icon = "minecraft:end_crystal"
module = "vane-core"
```
---
Everything in vane is fully configurable, and every feature can be disabled independently.
There are so many options that it would be far too much to list them here.

Be sure to have a look at the corresponding configuration file for each module.
Every option is carefully explained in there. The file path is `plugins/vane-<module>/config.yml`.
