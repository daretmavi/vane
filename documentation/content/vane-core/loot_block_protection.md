---
Vane is intended to be used with the `replenish-loot` option by PaperMC, which
replenishes loot in loot-chests after 1â€“2 realtime days. To make players aware of this,
vane prevents them from breaking loot chests accidentally. They can remove the block if desired,
but are warned before doing so.
