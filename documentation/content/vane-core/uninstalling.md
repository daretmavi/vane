Don't enjoy vane? Uninstalling it is fine and absolutely painless.
Remove the plugin jars, and everything will be back to normal.

If players had any custom item from vane, they will seemingly revert to their base
item, which is always of lower value compared to the custom item. If you reinstall
vane, they even re-gain their functionality.
May things will simply become a warped-fungus-on-a-stick.

If you are so kind, please let us know what was bothering you on our discord!
