To save on your server's resources, vane will shut down your server when 20 minutes have passed
while the server is empty.
This feature is especially great combined with the [Autostart](#feature-vane-velocity--autostart) feature by vane-velocity,
which automatically starts your server when someone tries to connect to it.
