```toml
title = "Better Chat Formatting"
icon = "minecraft:name_tag"
module = "vane-admin"

We always thought that the default chat format of minecraft seemed
a bit blunt and is hard to read. That's why vane alters the default
format of chat messages as well as join and leave notices slightly,
to contrast the sender's name against the actual content.
