---
Vane protects your world against some annoying hazards by default.
Disable any of these protections if they don't fit your play style.

- Entities cannot break doors
- Endermen don't steal blocks
- Lightning doesn't create fire
- Explosions caused by the wither and by creepers will be rebuilt. See [Creeper Protection](#feature-vane-admin--creeper_protection).
- The wither can only be spawned in the nether and the end.
