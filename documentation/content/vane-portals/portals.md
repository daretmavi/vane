## Overview

![](images/portal_boundary.png)

Portals are structures that let you travel to specific other portalsâ€”as many times as you want.
You can build them in almost any shape, and style them to externally match your building style.
It is the best way to travel great distances quickly. But beware, portals are expensive!

Right-clicking the portal console will open a menu where you can select any visible destination portal.
Afterwards, activate the portal lever and step through.

### Trivia

- Portals close automatically after 10 seconds.
- Any entity can traverse a portal, including items, horses and minecarts!
- Portals can be built horizontally.
- A portal cannot be activated if the destination portal is already connected somewhere else.
- Public portals can be activated by a redstone repeater.
- A portal can have multiple consoles.
- Any lever attached to the portal or next to the console can be used to control the portal.
- If a portal is in a vane-region, it gains two new visibility options to make it visible only to other portals in the same region or to players that have portal access in the region.
- Portals can be visible to only some players, but while a portal is opened, everyone may pass through.
