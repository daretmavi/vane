A multiplexer is an additional port for your server. When someone connects
via this port, they will be logged into a secondary player character. This also
works while being logged in on the main server. Beneficial for account sharing or
to hand out spectator accounts. Add a new serverlist entry with the alternative port
and enjoy having multiple accounts!

Two accounts is not enough? You can have as many multiplexers as you want.

Check out our [Server Installer](https://oddlama.github.io/minecraft-server) for information on how to set this up correctly.
