This feature allows you to have your server automatically start when a player tries to connect to it.
This is part of vane-velocity, a plugin for the [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity) proxy server.

Check out our [Server Installer](https://oddlama.github.io/minecraft-server) for information on how to set this up correctly.
